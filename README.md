Generalized Assignment Problem Solver written in C language.

This solver:
*   Reads the problem files from "\data" directory
*   Solves the problems with metaheuristics methods
*   Saves the results (cost, assignment, time) to the "\results" directory

Implemented metaheuristics methods are:
*   Simulated Annealing
*   Tabu Search
*   Iterated Local Search
*   GRASP
*   Threshold Accepting Method
